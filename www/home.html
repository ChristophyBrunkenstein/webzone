              <p>Good writer, not so good mather. Since childhood, I've spent the majority of my life behind a computer monitor, whether it be the computer lab at school or asking my parents if it was alright to use the dial-up at home. 
                Alas, while RuneScape certainly does teach you some math skills, such as if you buy 200 green dragonhides for 1100 each until you have enough to sell them in bulk for 1150 each, you'll make 50 GP/dragonhide, what RuneScape does not prepare you for is how to simplify the difference of binomial coefficients ∑k=0r(ak)(br−k).</p>

              I'm alone working the night shift at a residential care facility for elderly schizophrenics listening to my only friend Joe Rogan talk about life. In it, the guest mentions that "coding is awesome, and everyone should learn it."</p>
            <p>I had had a couple misfires in the past, but hardly passed saying "Hello" to the World. This time was different. I was motivated.
              I had a goal, and saw a path before me that I actually wanted to follow. 
              I spent a whopping 10 bucks on Udemy, and started my journey. And the dots began to connect. Learning didn't feel like a burden, nor did building feel like work. 
              The satisfaction of finding the solution to a problem that you've spent the last 2 hours on and seeing it function was a deep one. I had found what I wanted to do. Anyways, this was 4 years ago? It's 2025 and I'm in Japan now. It's fun. </p>
